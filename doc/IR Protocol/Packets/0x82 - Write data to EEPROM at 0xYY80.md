This packet tells the PokeWalker to write the data contained in the payload to the external EEPROM, at the address ``0xYY80``.  
``YY``, the most significant byte of the address, is given by the [Packet argument](../01%20-%20Packet%20Format.md#header-description) in the header.

The PokeWalker should respond to this packet with [Packet 0x04 - Acknowledge EEPROM write](0x04%20-%20Acknowledge%20EEPROM%20write.md), having the Packet argument field set to the same value as this packet.
