# Receive a Gift procedure
## Overview
This chapter focuses on the packets exchanged during the procedure named "Receive a Gift", which happens when the player has touched the "Receive a gift." button on Pokemon HGSS.

We are assuming that a communication has already been started, as described [here](02%20-%20Starting%20a%20Communication.md).

## Pokemon side: Sending general data
Pokemon sends its general data too, whose format looks to be the same as the one used in the PokeWalker general data packet.

Learn more about this packet [here](Packets/0x60%20-%20Pokemon%20General%20Data.md).
