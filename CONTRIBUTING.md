# Contributing

Anyone who wants to work on this project is welcome to contribute.
Just shoot a pull request or something.
I am not skilled enough to do this on my own, so all help is appreciated.


Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ymbTMsS) for more discussions about the topic/repo.


If you can, try and write something about what you did, how you did it etc.
I'd like people to be able to learn about hacking/reverse engineering from this project as well,
however the main goal remains to get a working emulator of some sorts.
