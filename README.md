# README

This project is about reverse engineering the pokewalker, a device designed for use with the Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver games.

The end goal is to hopefully be able to have the foundations to emulate its behaviour, such as:
- With a phone app that communicates to the walker/game through IR
- A full emulator to run the pokewalker software on.
- Custom hardware that emulates the pokewalker with extra features. (Raspberry Pi/Arduino app?)

Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ymbTMsS) for more discussion on the topic.

Documentation/findings can be found in the `docs/` directory of this repo.
Dumps can be found in the `dumps/` directory.
The dumps can be read as a binary file (.bin), a hex file (.txt) or as an image (.png).
The images look best at the 16-pixel width.

The hex for the 64K ROM is in `dumps/hex/64k-full-rom.txt`.
Corresponding binary file in `dumps/bin/` and image file in `dumps/img/`.

## What's Known
- The main MCU is a Renesas H8/38606F chip with 48K flash ROM and 2K RAM.
- The code is stored in the internal 48K MCU flash.
- The images are stored on the external 64K eeprom.
- Most text is stored as an image file on 64k ROM, except dynamic data like response text.
- Most images are stored as two 1-bit images, which are then presumably overlayed to give a 3-tone image. Probably a similar system to the gen 1 character sprites.

See `docs/` for more info.

## Next steps/To be done
- Get a ROM dump of the internal 48K ROM which contains all the code.
	- Decapping and looking at the MCU under a microscope might be the best approach.
	- Worth looking into the TX/RX signals, it's likely just echoing from the IR but it might be able to be exploited to run arbitrary code if intercepted.
	- Research on chip/code exploits to get a dump might be another option. "power glitch attack" was the recommended googling to learn more (thanks to `u/DarkJezter`)
	- It's a long shot, but might be able to intercept the tx/rx signal and somehow get the MCU to write the 48K ROM contents to the external EEPROM.
- Decode IR signal
	- Structure (See GBA Temp forum thread)
	- Protocol
- Might be able to write code to the internal ROM somehow.
